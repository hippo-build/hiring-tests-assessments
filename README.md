# Welcome to your React Interview

> This round is to test your practical knowledge by getting done the missed features of a React application.

Feel like you're working with your peers in a pair coding session on the missing project features; we encourage you to have a conversation during the test with the interviewers

## Shopping Cart:

This project consists of a movie store with some particular characteristics, such as only being able to buy one title per movie and prices that decrease over the years.
- Each movie must be able to be added to the cart.
- Put the date next to the name of the movie.
- To set  each movie's price, consider the following pattern:  2022: 80,000. 2021: 75,000, 2020: 70,000, 2019: 65,000 and all others at 50,000.
- If the movie is already in the cart, it should not be able to be added again.
- If the movie is in the shopping cart, show the icon to remove it in the movie's view.
- Create the component on the landing to see how many movies and the cart's total value.
- Create a page for when you click on the cart to see the purchase summary.

**Good luck!**
